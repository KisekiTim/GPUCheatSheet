Hello

This repository contains some basic codes and functions of CUDA GPU programming and instructions on how to compile into a dll and linking it via C or python.
Contains no proprietary or confidential code of any kind.  All information here is for educational purposes and provided as is.

01 Shows the most basic structure of a CUDA program, including initializing arrays on system memory, moving it to the GPU memory,  performing a mathematical function on the GPU and copying the results back.

02 Shows some examples how to compile C code into a dll file and how to link to the dll file for use in other programs.
